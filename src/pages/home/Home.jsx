        <h2>Welcome to BeautyByyBai</h2>
        <p>My name is Bailey Smith, and I attended cosmetology school from August 2021 to June 2022 
          at Empire Beauty School. During my time there, I learned so many amazing things that have 
          shaped me into the professional I am today. I specialize in blonding, coloring, waxing, 
          womenâ€™s cuts, special occasion makeup and hair, as well as styling hair. I currently work 
          from home 2-3 days a week, and within the next year, I plan to transition to a salon 
          called [Salon Name]. I am also considering getting certified in extensions and laser hair 
          treatments in the future. My passion is helping people feel beautiful and empowering them 
          to be their best selves.</p>
